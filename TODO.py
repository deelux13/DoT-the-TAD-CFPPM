UBQ blueprin

UBQ 2 giver hold coin quest

exit out of UBQ

make the start a little more robust

settlement

optimize speed and pixel specific, region looking

record UBQ collections

ubq abort finding is rough. needs an LZutil probably that returns a list.

make the findClick or something return # so that UBQ logic can just check for
pay image or pay pixels and then be faster


2 givers is not working

pull specific pixels?

pyautogui.PAUSE = 0

UBQ is clicking the top when there is a UBQ onscreen... i think it doesn't realize the UBQ is actually onscreen like the bottom clips... or something'
